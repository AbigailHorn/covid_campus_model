# A model of COVID-19 transmission and control on university campuses 

_This is a Web-Based Tool for Modeling COVID-19 on University Campuses_

This software tool is based on the mathematical models in the paper:

**Before using this tool to guide any decisions, it is critical to read the full paper in order to understand the assumptions and limitations of this models.  Results should not be taken at face value.  This tool provides a way to explore the possible range of outcomes on campus over the course of a semester. However, there are a number of important things not captured in the fairly simple model -- like the structure of student housing or the impact of mask-wearing.**

This webtool provides tools to explore the model of transmission of SARS-COV-2 among university students, staff and faculty.

_All control measures are initiated by diagnostics_
*Screening* is a strategy in which students, staff, and faculty are tested at a given frequency regardless of the presence of symptoms. We assume that there is no contact tracing or quarantine initiated by screening.  
*Testing* is a strategy whereby symptomatic students, staff, and faculty present for clinical care and are tested using RT-PCR. 

The **"Main"** section shows a single run of the model outcome using the default parameters. You can change the model options to better fit your campus characteristics. In addition, you can modify the intervention you wish to explore. And, you can change which output is visualized in the graphs. After selecting the parameters set in each model, the model will automatically update the plots and summary data tables.

The **"Sensitivity analysis"** section allows you to select a range for some of the parameters and simulate multiple models using probability sampling. 

The **"Raw Parameters"** section contains the default values for the model. The initial values are similar to the ones used in the paper. You can change them to explore different scenarios. **Warning**: *this is an advanced feature. Entering certain values will cause the model to not run or give implausible results. Be careful before you change any values on this page.*
