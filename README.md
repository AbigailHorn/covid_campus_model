# COVID19 Campus Model Summary
The COVID19 Campus Model is a tool to guide mitigation strategies and resource needs for universities considering in-person instruction for Fall 2020. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) type of deterministic compartmental model that captures transmission process, allowing for estimates of direct and indirect (transmission-mediated) effects of control strategies.
